 Imported the required packages
 Intialised the classifier as sequential()
 Add Convolution
 Add Pooling (forms in 2*2 array size)
 Add Flattening(To make it in one vector format)
 Activating the function (used relu and sigmoid)
 Compiled
 Rescale the Image(Training and testing data)
 Fitting the model
 In order to increase the accuracy hidden layer developed after pooling step. Do the parameter tuning in order to achieve better accuracy.
